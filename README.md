# DauntlessOverwatch

Overwatch is a game I play and contains lots of player data. 

I decided to practice REST calls by making this page which takes an Overwatch battletag and returns profile data.


## Inputs
Submission requires an existing (case sensitive) battletag.

Example input: Shauntdh#1451

## Tools
Angular as front-end framework.

Bootstrap as css framework.

Firebase to host the static web page.

https://ow-api.com/ is used to grab data and display on page.
